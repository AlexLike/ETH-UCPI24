# Course Format

This research seminar group meets weekly for 90 minutes discussions on selected topics. Each week we will discuss two topics. Students are expected to read the assigned papers in advance. For each topic, two discussion leaders will be assigned: one will present on the topic, and the other will moderate the discussion.

By the end of the semester, students will submit a short writeup (\~800 words) of their presented topic in the form of a blog post. Students are expected to explore additional research papers on that topic, summarize the opinions collected from the seminar discussions, and connect the conversation to relevant literature. Students are encouraged to be creative with their blog post, for example, adding visuals, creating [explorable explanations](https://explorabl.es/), creating a TikTok style video preview. Together, we will update this site as a collective learning resource for future students and researchers.
