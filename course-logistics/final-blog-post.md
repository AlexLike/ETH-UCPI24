# Final Blog Post

### What is a blog post?

The final blog post should give any computer science student, even if they've never heard of the topic, a quick and clear understanding of what itâ€™s all about. It should highlight the latest research in the area and include some interesting thoughts and perspectives from you, the author, to keep things engaging.

The blog post is **different** from writing a summary of a research paper, or writing a literature review. You should write it in accessible and conversational tone to make technical content understandable and engaging for a broad audience. You can find examples here at Blog@CACM: [https://cacm.acm.org/section/blogcacm/](https://cacm.acm.org/section/blogcacm/).

### Is there a template or structure?

There is no template or structure. Length-wise, please keep your blog post around 800\~1200 words. However, we do ask you to provide your name, and a short bio to be included on the final course website.

In general we are hoping to see the following perspectives being covered by your blog:

* Motivating the research topic
  * Is the topic well-motivated?
  * Is the relevance of the topic clearly explained?
* Depth of the content
  * Does the blog post provide valuable insights for experts? Does it demonstrate the author's deep understanding of the topic?
* Engagement and clarity
  * Does the blog post explain ideas in a way that general audiences can understand? Is the content engaging?
* Writing
  * Is the blog post well-written? Does the author cite and integrate quality sources?
* Bonus point
  * Forward-thinking: Does the blog post offer new insights or creative perspectives on the topic? We encourage you to think wild about the future of programming interfaces on your chosen topic.

### Should I find additional papers on the topic?

Yes, we expect you to find additional papers on the topic -- you might have already done a good job finding them for your presentation! If you mention an idea from a paper, or an article, please cite them properly using the[ APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/).

But keep in mind this is not a literature review so we are not chasing for **numbers.** It' about providing a targeted review and discussion on a topic. On the reading list, you already have 2-3 readings on this topic, and in the end, we are looking for >=5 sources.

### Getting Early Feedback

* (Optional) We can provide one round of feedback for each blog post if you create a PR by 12.15
  * Feel free to share any draft level, including bullet points, for feedback.
  * We will get back to you no later than 12.22.

### Due Date

* The final blog post is due on **12.31**.
* In the end, we will merge everyone's PR and you can view the blogs on this [course website](https://peachlab.gitbook.io/seminar-on-user-centered-programming-interfaces).

### How to Submit?

* Fork this gitbook repository ([https://github.com/ETH-PEACH-Lab/UCPI-website](https://github.com/ETH-PEACH-Lab/UCPI-website))
* Under `./Topics`, find the topic markdown file that you presented as the main presenter.
* After making changes to the repository, create a pull request to the original gitbook repository.
